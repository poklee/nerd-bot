## Getting Started For Developers

### Lombok
This project uses lombok to generate getters and builders.  To get rid of the errors in your IDE, download the appropriate lombok plugin for eclipse or IntelliJ.  See https://projectlombok.org/ for details.

### Deploy

Use maven to build and docker-compose to create the container to run.  Setting up Slack app is also needed, talk with Pok about this.
